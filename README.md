# ROI_Focused_MarketingBudgetAllocation-Linear_Programming_Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to effectively allocate the marketing budget across various channels, a crucial determinant of the return on marketing investment. The focus is on formulating a strategy that maximizes Return on Investment (ROI) through optimal allocation across different media channels.

## Problem Definition
We address the challenge of determining the best budget allocation for each media channel to ensure the highest returns. The project outlines the following objectives:
- Determine the investment amount in various media channels.
- Analyze how budget allocations differ based on ROI estimates from two consultancies.
- Evaluate 'What-If' scenarios for ROI variances.
- Devise a re-investment strategy for returns.
- Ensure budget stability, defined as changes in allocation not exceeding $1M per month.

## Solution Approach
The solution involves:
- Defining an objective function to maximize ROI on marketing investments.
- Using Gurobi software for deriving optimal solutions.
- Ensuring the total marketing budget does not exceed $10M, with a maximum of $3M allocated to each media platform.
- Maintaining a minimum investment in social media at twice that of SEO and AdWords.
- Evaluating the stability of budget allocation and proposing methods to ensure consistency.

## Insights and Recommendations
- Despite identical ROI amounts, fund allocation varies significantly between the two consultancies.
- A cross-match of ROI expectations and fund allocation can lead to suboptimal returns of more than 40%.
- Removing the investment cap on each platform could potentially increase ROI but may limit market reach.
- Sensitivity analysis is crucial for real-time decision-making and corrective actions.

## Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the software to replicate the optimization model and derive budget allocations.
